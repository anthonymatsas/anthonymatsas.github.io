Welcome to my personal website/portfolio. I just added jekyll to the site because I want to start blogging. Posts will either be related to current projects I will be working on or random things I want to remble on about. I have attempted many times in the past to maintain some sort of blog and have always ended not posting much, so I am hoping this time I can post a couple times a month.

I decided to use Jekyll because it offers a great static solution to blogging and works great with Github pages. Also, it has awesome built in support for code snippets. Here is an example below:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
function hello($name) {
	echo "Hello, " . $name;
}

hello("Tony");
//prints 'Hello, Tony'.
?>
{% endhighlight %}

Anyways, thanks for taking a look at my website and reading my first post:) Have an awesome rest of your day!
