With school coming to an end I am trying to come up with a project to work on, so I can build up a portfolio. I really want to do something involving sports, especially basketball, but I just can not think of anything! So far I have the following ideas:

* NBA winner projector
* Web based music player
* Fantasy basketball simulator (Either browser based or as an Android App)
* Basic compiler
* Basic note taking app (Even though I use Sublime Text for EVERYTHING! :p)

That is all I have so far! And I just can not make up my mind, so I as soon as this Spring semester ends in 2 weeks, all of my attention will be focused on building a portfolio full of cool things! I am hoping to build all summer long, so if you have any suggestions or ideas feel free to email me them! You can contact me by clicking the Contact link up above in the navigation bar.
