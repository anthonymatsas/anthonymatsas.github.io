Welcome! My name is Anthony and I am currently a student at Lewis University as a computer science major. I have always been very passionate about computing and technology in general. My first experience with code came at the age of 12, which of course was with HTML and CSS, so I do not know if that really counts :) That is when I realized how amazing code is, especially how it lets you be super creative with any problem you face. In my eyes code is an art, which takes a ton of practice and a ton of screwing up before finally mastering! 

This blog will mostly include thoughts and comments that arise from my coursework. I love to code, so I will definitly be posting many snippets that I find helpful. In addition to that, I will be posting about the one and only Chicago Bulls. I am a die hard Bull's fan, but a bigger basketball fan in general. To whoever might be following a long with me through my journey, I hope you enjoy my blog! Thank you for reading!

P.S enjoy this jam :)
